# django CMS quickstart

A Dockerised django CMS project, ready to deploy on [Divio](https://www.divio.com/) or another Docker-based cloud platform, and run locally in Docker on your own machine.

This version uses Python 3.8 running and the most up-to-date versions of Django 3.1 and django CMS 3.8.

## Installation

You need to have docker installed on your system to run this project.

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) here.
- If you have not used docker in the past, please read this [introduction on docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) here.

## Try it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:django-cms/django-cms-quickstart.git
cd django-cms-quickstart
docker-compose build
docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
docker-compose up
open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```


## Customising the project

This project is ready-to-go without making any changes at all, but also gives you some options.

As-is, it will include a number of useful django CMS plugins and Bootstrap 4 for the frontend. You don't have to use
these; they're optional. If you don't want to use them, read through the `settings.py` and `requirements.txt` files to
see sections that can be removed - in each case, the section is noted with a comment containing the word 'optional'.

Options are also available for using Postgres/MySQL, uWSGI/Gunicorn/Guvicorn, etc.
